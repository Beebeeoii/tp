## About Quick Contacts

* Quick Contacts (QC) is a cross-platform desktop application that enables you to easily manage your contacts and meetings all in one place!
  * Designed for users who have a **large** number of contacts (many of which are only **temporarily**)<br>
  * **Fast** and **easy** to use
  * **GUI** and **CLI** supported
    * **Lightweight** and **portable**

* It is named `Quick Contacts` (`QC` for short) because most contacts stored in here are intended to be stored quickly and deleted promptly when not needed.
### Acknowledgements
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
